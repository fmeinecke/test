# Fashion AI @ Zalando Book

This book is not a typical book: It is not a static collection of chapters written as a snapshot at some point in time but instead a living document of the current systems and research efforts in each of the areas. It is written and maintained by the entire research community at Zalando. The book is written using [*bookdown*](https://bookdown.org/) accessible to everyone through continuous deployment on GitHub Enterprise.

## Purpose

We created this project with the following three tenets in mind:

1. **Raising the Scientific Bar**. Research is a process of continual experimentation, documentation, review and revision by a community of researchers. We believe that sharing honestly and objectively what algorithms we are using in our systems, what experiments we ran and their results, and inviting reviews from the whole research community at Zalando will perpetually raise the scientific bar in all our applications of (Fashion) AI at Zalando.
2. **Enable Knowledge and People Transfer**. This project should also make it easier for new joiners or internal transfers to onboard with our scientific algorithms. Before the availability of this living document, known scientific expertise was with people and if they left the team, the knowledge usually disappeared (["tribal knowledge paradox"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_knowledge)).
3. **Infrastructure for Scientific Rigor in Projects**. This project is only successful if it provides the infrastructure to allow regular scientific reviews in all business and delivery teams at Zalando. When designing features of this repository, we have in mind that it needs to be in support, not in opposition, of the workflow of all business and delivery teams at Zalando.
